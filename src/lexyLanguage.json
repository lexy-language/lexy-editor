(On GitHub)](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Introduction/1_Philosophy.md)\n\n## Transparent and consistent Tax Laws\n\nThe mission of Lexy is to encourage governments to publish their Tax Laws as executable lexy scripts. It would ensure everyone knows how taxes are calculated, and that everyone adheres to the same rules.\n\nView published executable [Tax Laws](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/publications.md) written in Lexy.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nLexy is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) designed by Tim Cools to describe tax laws. Currently, tax laws are published and updated with textual descriptions (Tax Laws), often ambiguous and open for interpretation. \nBesides that, the effective tax calculation code contains exceptions for individuals and companies which are sometimes not even approved by official laws or rulings.\nThe tax system in most countries favors people with a lot of money and/or influence who can pay expensive specialists to learn how to avoid paying taxes. This contributes to widening income and wealth inequality.\n\n- What: Executable tax laws published by governments\n- Who: Used by lawmakers, scientific researchers, tax specialists, IT companies implementing tax laws, and students.\n- Why: Consistency and transparency: we believe tax returns should be published in public (as in some countries in Scandinavia)\n\nAdvantages:\n- Official Tax Laws: when executable Tax Laws are published in a public Git repository, applications can always update to the latest version by getting the latest version of the laws. If the input for the Tax calculation isn't changed, that application does not need to be recompiled. Otherwise, it needs to provide the new input of course.\n- Computer language independent: Calculations can be integrated into existing and new applications regardless of the language the application is written in. \n- Real-time execution: The calculations can be changed and executed in real-time, without recompiling the host application.\n- Simple and readable: the goal is to keep the language as simple as possible. It should be readable by advanced (non-developer) spreadsheet users. \n- Transparency: during the execution of a lexy script every decision is logged for future reference\n- Versioning: versioning can be accomplished by traditional development tools like git, or managed by the application itself.\n\nBesides describing Tax Laws, the language can also be used to implement all kinds of calculations that benefit from these advantages. \n\nHosting:\n- Public portal/ Local IDE: lexy provides a [demo!](https://lexy-language.github.io/lexy-editor/) so you can learn more about the language.\n- The Lexy script compiler can be implemented in any programming language. Current compilers: [typescript/javascript](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-typescript) and [.NET](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-dotnet) \n- Blockchain: Publishing and executing laws on a blockchain was Tim's initial idea. The main problem a blockchain solves is the decentralization of trust. While the lack of a central authority can be useful in some cases (a currency), this is only necessary when multiple organizations can't fully trust each other. We believe that governments should be able to trust themselves, and should be trusted by their citizens. So storing and executing tax scripts would be an irresponsible use of computing and storage resources. A blockchain that publicly publishes immutable lexy scripts, executes them, and publishes the results in public might have different use cases though.\n\n## Learn More\n\nThe documentation can be viewed in two ways:\n\n🖥️ [Interactive DEMO! (Web from a desktop browser only for now)](https://lexy-language.github.io/lexy-editor/) \n📄 [Documentation!

Do you have any of the following to contribute?\n\n- Political Influence (Politician/Lobbyist/Activist)\n- Knowledge of Tax Law (Student/Professor/Domain Expert/Developer)\n- Software Developer\n- Media (Journalist/Content Creator)\n- Organisational (Management)\n- Anything else you think of that can contribute to helping the mission succeed?\n\nHow can you help?\n- Implement your local Tax Laws in Lexy and publish them in public on GitHub as examples. They can be added to the publications.md if they are fairly complete.\n- Convert the compiler to other languages so you can run Lexy scripts in your favourite language or existing code-base? (java, php, ruby, c, c++, rust, ...)\n- Demand governments to publish the real Tax Lax used in their system as an executable Lexy script. First step is to be fully transparent about how taxes are calculated and about which exemptions are in the code or hidden in the Tax rules.\n- Moderate the Discord or help management of the GitHub projects\n\nIf you want to work on any of these, please discuss first on **Discord** so that people are not working on the same compiler for example:\n\n[![](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/https://discord.gg/JmzvKNWFqE)](https://discord.gg/JmzvKNWFqE)\n\n## Compilers\n\n[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-typescript)\n[![Build lexy-typescript](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-typescript/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-typescript/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n![Coverage](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lexy-language/9179085a171f9629b868662611e06fbd/raw/badges.svg)\n\n[![.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-512BD4?style=for-the-badge&logo=dotnet&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-dotnet)\n[![Build lexy-dotnet](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-dotnet/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-dotnet/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lexy-language/5cd196aad8e9065cdba88b922a8d7bd6/raw/coverage.svg)\n\n## Editor\n\n[![Build lexy-editor](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-editor/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-editor/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n\n## Known improvements\n\n- [ ] More scenarios for side cases and alternative branches of the current parser. Code coverage reveals validations, ... which are not verified in the language specifications yet\n\n## Future ideas\n\n- [ ] Tables: support of csv and/or json tables\n- [ ] Syntax: support identifiers with underscore '_' (double underscores should not be allowed as it is reserved for system functions and variables)\n- [ ] Versioning: document versioning strategy for lexy scripts in Git (branches) and how to reuse scripts (by using submodules) \n- [ ] Versioning: document versioning strategy for **lexy-langage** and its dependencies\n- [ ] Validation: check tables are sorted alphabetically."

Everything on a line after a # will be ignored by the compiler.\n\n## Indentation\n\nIndentation is used to determine the structure of a lexy script. Lexy support a strict indentation of 2 spaces or a tab. \nComponent keywords are always placed at the first character of a line.\nChildren of keywords always use 2 spaces more as indentation as their parent.\n\n```\nfunction FirstFunction       // no indentation, start of a function component\n  parameters                 // 2 spaces indentation, Parameters belongs to the function component declared above\n    number Income            // 4 spaces indentation, the Income variable belongs to the Parameters of the defined Function\n  results                    // 2 spaces indentation, Results belongs to the function component declared above\n    number Tax               // 4 spaces indentation, the Tax variable belongs to the Results of the defined Function\n    number TaxRate           // 4 spaces indentation, the TaxRate variable belongs to the Results of the defined Function\n  TaxRate = 0.5              // 2 spaces indentation, the assignment is part of the function code\n  Tax = Income * TaxRate     // 42spaces indentation, the assignment is part of the function code\n                             // empty lines are ignored by the compiler\nfunction SecondFunction      // no indentation, start of a new function component\n```\n\n\n# Next\n\n🖥 ️📄 [Next topic: Example](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Introduction/3_Example.md)\n"

It will show you the results variables of the function. If you click Execution Logging below, you can see all the execute lines and the variables used on this line. This can be stored for transparency and debugging.\n\nLexy has built in automated testing to describe the desire behavior of a function. These are called a Scenario. Scenarios are useful to specific the expected results while executing a function with certain parameters. They are useful to ensure functions keeps working after the code is updated or refactored.\n\n## Scenario\n\n```\nscenario NaiveFlatTaxLawSpecifications\n  function NaiveFlatTaxLaw\n  parameters\n    GrossIncomeYear = 120000\n  results\n    TaxableIncomeYear = 108000\n    TaxRate = 0.4\n    TotalTax = 43200\n```\n\nScenarios are validated in real time.

Eg: `Variable.Field`\n\n```\ntype CustomParameters\n  number NumberValue\n  string TextValue\n  \ntype CustomResults\n  number NumberResult\n  string TextResult\n\nfunction AssignNestedFields\n  parameters\n    CustomParameters Values\n  results\n    CustomResults Result\n  \n  Result.NumberResult = Values.NumberValue\n  Result.TextResult = Values.TextValue\n```\n\nUse a point `.` to access the field of variable.\n\n```\nscenario NestedFieldsWithMemberAccessor\n  function AssignNestedFields\n  parameters\n    Values.NumberValue = 777\n    Values.TextValue = \"abc\"\n  results\n    Result.NumberResult = 777\n    Result.TextResult = \"abc\"\n```\n\nUse indentation of define the fields of a parent variable.\n\n```\nscenario NestedFieldsWithNesting\n  function AssignNestedFields\n  parameters\n    Values =\n      NumberValue = 777\n      TextValue = \"abc\"\n  results\n    Result = \n      NumberResult = 777\n      TextResult = \"abc\"\n```\n\nIn a ValidationTable it's also possible to access the fields of a variable:\n\n```\nscenario NestedFieldsWithTable\n  function AssignNestedFields\n  validationTable\n    | Values.NumberValue | Values.TextValue | Result.NumberResult | Result.TextResult | \n    | 5                  | \"abc\"            | 5                   | \"abc\"             |   \n    | 8                  | \"def\"            | 8                   | \"def\"             |\n```\n\n# Next\n\n🖥 ️📄 [Next topic: Future](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Introduction/b_Future.md)\n"

They define the expected output behavior and even expected compilation and validation errors. These specifications ensure that all lexy compiler implementations in all different languages have the same expected behavior. Have a look at the '[README](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md)' in the 'Specifications' folder for more information about the specifications.\n\n### Last note\n\nWe hope you enjoyed the introduction!\n\nAgain, the main goal of Lexy is to encourage governments to publish their Tax Laws in a readable, transparent and executable form!\n\n## What's next?\n\nWhat's next? How can you help?\n- Do you like the mission of Lexy? Share about Lexy on your social media?\n- Do you want to contribute to Lexy? Have a look at the contribute paragraph on the [README](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/) of the lexy-language repository!\n- [Check out the interactive DEMO!](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md) - View, edit and creat your own Lexy script from the browser. (Desktop Only)\n\n### Do you have knowledge about Tax Laws? Or you'd like to contribute in another way?\n\nHow can you help?\n- Implement your local Tax Laws in Lexy and publish them in public on GitHub as examples. They can be added to the publications.md if they are fairly complete.\n- Convert the compiler to other languages so you can run Lexy scripts in your favourite language or existing code-base? (java, php, ruby, c, c++, rust, ...)\n- Demand governments to publish the real Tax Lax used in their system as an executable Lexy script. First step is to be fully transparent about how taxes are calculated and about which exemptions are in the code or hidden in the Tax rules.\n- Moderate the Discord or help management of the GitHub projects\n\nIf you want to work on any of these, please discuss first on **Discord** so that people are not working on the same compiler for example:\n\n[![](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/https://discord.gg/JmzvKNWFqE)](https://discord.gg/JmzvKNWFqE)\n\n### For the techies...\n\n- [Check out Lexy Language Specifications!](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md)\n\n- [Check out TypeScript Compiler](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md)\n\n- [Check out .NET Compiler](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md)\n\n## ❤ and ☮\n\n**Tim & Sarah Cools️**"
