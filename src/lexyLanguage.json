      "code": "# lexy-language\n\n# Transparent and consistent Tax Laws\n\nThe mission of Lexy is to encourage governments to publish their Tax Laws as executable lexy scripts. It would ensure everyone knows how taxes are calculated, and that everyone adheres to the same rules.\n\nView published executable [Tax Laws](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/publications.md) written in Lexy.\n\n# Philosophy\n\nLexy is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) designed by Tim Cools to describe tax laws. Currently, tax laws are published and updated with textual descriptions (Tax Laws), often ambiguous and open for interpretation. \nBesides that, the effective tax calculation code contains exceptions for individuals and companies which are sometimes not even approved by official laws or rulings.\nThe tax system in most countries favors people with a lot of money and/or influence who can pay expensive specialists to learn how to avoid paying taxes. This contributes to widening income and wealth inequality.\n\n- What: Executable tax laws published by governments\n- Who: Used by lawmakers, scientific researchers, tax specialists, IT companies implementing tax laws, and students.\n- Why: Consistency and transparency: we believe tax returns should be published in public (as in some countries in Scandinavia)\n\nAdvantages:\n- Official Tax Laws: when executable Tax Laws are published in a public Git repository, applications can always update to the latest version by getting the latest version of the laws. If the input for the Tax calculation isn't changed, that application does not need to be recompiled. Otherwise, it needs to provide the new input of course.\n- Computer language independent: Calculations can be integrated into existing and new applications regardless of the language the application is written in. \n- Real-time execution: The calculations can be changed and executed in real-time, without recompiling the host application.\n- Simple and readable: the goal is to keep the language as simple as possible. It should be readable by advanced (non-developer) spreadsheet users. \n- Transparency: during the execution of a lexy script every decision is logged for future reference\n- Versioning: versioning can be accomplished by traditional development tools like git, or managed by the application itself.\n\nBesides describing Tax Laws, the language can also be used to implement all kinds of calculations that benefit from these advantages. \n\nHosting:\n- Public portal/ Local IDE: lexy provides a [demo!](https://lexy-language.github.io/lexy-editor/) so you can learn more about the language.\n- Any host programming language: currently dotnet and typescript/javascript\n- Blockchain: Publishing laws on a blockchain, and calculating taxes on a blockchain was the initial idea. The main problem a blockchain solves is the decentralization of trust. While the lack of a central authority can be useful in some cases (a currency), this is only necessary when multiple organizations can't fully trust each other. We believe that governments should be able to trust themselves, and should be trusted by their citizens. So storing and executing tax scripts would be an irresponsible use of computing and storage resources. A blockchain that publicly publishes immutable lexy scripts, executes them, and publishes the results in public might have different use cases though.\n- GPU\n\n## Learn More\n\n🖥️ [Interactive DEMO!

Everything on a line after a # will be ignored by the compiler.\n\n## Indentation\n\nIndentation is used to determine the structure of a lexy script. \n\n```\nFunction: FirstFunction       # no indentation, start of a function component\n  Parameters                  # 2 spaces indentation, Parameters belongs to the function component declared above\n    number Income             # 4 spaces indentation, the Income variable belongs to the Parameters of the defined Function\n  Results                     # 2 spaces indentation, Results belongs to the function component declared above\n    number Tax                # 4 spaces indentation, the Tax variable belongs to the Results of the defined Function\n    number TaxRate            # 4 spaces indentation, the TaxRate variable belongs to the Results of the defined Function\n  Code                        # 2 spaces indentation, Code belongs to the function component declared above\n    TaxRate = 0.5             # 4 spaces indentation, the assignment is part of the Code\n    Tax = Income * TaxRate    # 4 spaces indentation, the assignment is part of the Code\n                              # empty lines are ignored by the compiler\nFunction: SecondFunction      # no indentation, start of a new function component\n\n```\n\nLexy support a strict indentation of 2 spaces or a tab. \n\n# Next\n\n🖥 ️📄 [Next topic: Example](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Introduction/3_Example.md)\n\n"

It will show you the results variables of the function. If you click Execution Logging below, you can see all the execute lines and the variables used on this line. This can be stored for transparency and debugging.\n\nLexy has built in automated testing to describe the desire behavior of a function. These are called a Scenario. Scenarios are useful to specific the expected results while executing a function with certain parameters. They are useful to ensure functions keeps working after the code is updated or refactored.\n\n## Scenario\n\n```\nScenario: NaiveFlatTaxLawSpecifications\n  Function NaiveFlatTaxLaw\n  Parameters\n    GrossIncomeYear = 120000\n  Results\n    TaxableIncomeYear = 108000\n    TaxRate = 0.4\n    TotalTax = 43200\n```\n\nScenarios are validated in real time.

If you change any of the values in the function code, or in the scenario, the scenario will turn red.\n\n## Validation Table\n\nScenarios also supports a validation table which allows to validate many scenarios from a single table.\n\n```\nScenario: NaiveTaxLawScenarios\n  Function NaiveTaxLaw\n  ValidationTable\n    | Income  | TaxRate  | Tax   |\n    | 12000   | 0.2      | 2400  |\n    | 18000   | 0.3      | 5400  |\n    | 20000   | 0.4      | 8000  |\n    | 30000   | 0.5      | 15000 |\n    | 40000   | 0.6      | 24000 |\n    | 80000   | 0.6      | 48000 |\n    | 100000  | 0.6      | 60000 |\n```\n\n## Nested Parameters and results\nThere are two ways to define nested parameters and results in scenarios.\n- By using a point `.` to access the field of the variable. Eg: `Variable.Field`\n- By using a point `.` to access the field of the variable. Eg: `Variable.Field`\n\n```\nType: CustomParameters\n  number NumberValue\n  string TextValue\n  \nType: CustomResults\n  number NumberResult\n  string TextResult\n\nFunction: AssignNestedFields\n  Parameters\n    CustomParameters Values\n  Results\n    CustomResults Result\n  Code\n    Result.NumberResult = Values.NumberValue\n    Result.TextResult = Values.TextValue\n```\n\nUse a point `.` to access the field of variable.\n\n```\nScenario: NestedFieldsWithMemberAccessor\n  Function AssignNestedFields\n  Parameters\n    Values.NumberValue = 777\n    Values.TextValue = \"abc\"\n  Results\n    Result.NumberResult = 777\n    Result.TextResult = \"abc\"\n```\n\nUse indentation of define the fields of a parent variable.\n\n```\nScenario: NestedFieldsWithNesting\n  Function AssignNestedFields\n  Parameters\n    Values =\n      NumberValue = 777\n      TextValue = \"abc\"\n  Results\n    Result = \n      NumberResult = 777\n      TextResult = \"abc\"\n```\n\nIn a ValidationTable it's also possible to access the fields of a variable:\n\n```\nScenario: NestedFieldsWithTable\n  Function AssignNestedFields\n  ValidationTable\n    | Values.NumberValue | Values.TextValue | Result.NumberResult | Result.TextResult | \n    | 5                  | \"abc\"            | 5                   | \"abc\"             |   \n    | 8                  | \"def\"            | 8                   | \"def\"             |\n```\n\n# Next\n\n🖥 ️📄 [Next topic: Future](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Introduction/b_Future.md)\n"

They define the expected output behavior and even expected compilation and validation errors. These specifications ensure that all lexy compiler implementations in all different languages have the same expected behavior. Have a look at the '[README](https://github.com/lexy-language/lexy-language/blob/main/Specifications/Readme.md)' in the 'Specifications' folder for more information about the specifications.\n\n### Last note\n\nWe hope you enjoyed the introduction!\n\nAgain, the main goal of Lexy is to encourage governments to publish their Tax Laws in a readable, transparent and executable form!\n\n## What's next?\n\nWhat's next?
